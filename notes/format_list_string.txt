Sometimes it's a pain to type EVERY formatted thing when there's
too many of them.

print(f"I have {a}, {b}, {c}, {d}, ..........................")

You can easily apply a list to a format string like this:

def function(variable):
    a = 1
    b = 2
    c = 3

print("string string {} {}, string, {}.".format(function))

use .format(function variable) at the end.
