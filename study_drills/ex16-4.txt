Why was 'w' passed as an extra parameter to _open_?

Hint: _open_ tries to be safe by making you 
explicitly say you want to write a file.


Because by default .open() opens the file in the
'rt' mode. It is basically reading text, not editing.

Because if you want to write to the file, Python will
actually truncate it before allowing user input.

If the file is important, then it is therefore safer
to make open() by default open to read only.
