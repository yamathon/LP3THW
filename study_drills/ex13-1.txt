Error:

ValueError: not enough values to unpack (expected 4, got 3)


Four variables were assigned to argv, so therefore it 
expects four arguments to be entered to be assigned to
those variables.

If you don't input the correct number of arguments, argv
cannot proceed due to the missing variable not having any
value, so argv itself doesn't have any value to work with.

All the four variables make up argv, they are just
pieces broken up into four.
