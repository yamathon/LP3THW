Why was out_file.close() in the code?

I guess because if it's not closed, then it is still
open for editing even though the python program itself
finished executing and closes. It is probably the 
best practice to close files once you're done 
editing them.

It's common sense. You open a file, edit it, and finally
close it. 

Best practices?
