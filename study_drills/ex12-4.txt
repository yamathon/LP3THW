open(), file(), os(), sys() notes


-> open()
this has several modes you can choose to open the specified file with.

when you type open(argument), it by default
resorts to the 'rt' mode even though you didn't specify any mode.

'rt' is open for reading

The modes are all about writing to the file.

'r', "read"
'w', "write"
'x', "create new file"
'a', "append"

File types:
'b', "binary mode"
't', "text mode"
'+', "open, read, write disk file"

Notable traits:
- Python looks at files as either text or binary
- Python opens text as strings depending on the encoding to
decode/encode files
- the 'w' truncates file first, then opens it for editing.



-> file()
The pydoc command returns nothing for some weird reason.

-> os()
this exports a lot of functions from "posix". 

Programs that import and use this are better at running in
different platforms.

Changes the way how files are being handled in byte streams?
paths? this documentation is confusing.

-> sys()
imports access to objects maintained by the Python interpreter
and functions that interact with the interpreter.

way to change the input of files?
